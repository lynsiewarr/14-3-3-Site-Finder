# 14-3-3-Site-Finder

The app folder contains the RShiny code file for the webapp at https://rconnect.byu.edu/14-3-3-site-finder/ . It also contains the training data for the models used in the tool, and normalization score file for predictions for other proteins that might be entered for predictions.

(Future: add simple R script file just to fit full model and provide importance plot.)
